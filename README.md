## Introduction

In times of decreasing quantities of music sales, touring is becoming a more important aspect for artists to consider. Thus, keeping an eye on tour schedules becomes increasingly difficult for music fans as the number of concerts is growing continuously. Event directories such as [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm) and [Songkick](https://www.songkick.com) offer text-based listings of tour stops around the world in order to facilitate their discovery by potential audiences. The project at hand extends these listings in favor of a novel event visualization approach using [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps). The rationale is that fans are rather interested in being able to locate shows in spatial vicinity by consulting a map than scanning through extensive lists of events. Furthermore, the presented application is augmented with microblog data, effectively displaying [Twitter](https://twitter.com) messages in order to discover the locations of artists' dedicated fan bases and thereby assisting musicians and their management in the planning of tours.

## How to get stared
